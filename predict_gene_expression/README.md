# Machine Learning Pipeline for Single-Cell Perturbation Prediction

Predict how small molecules change gene expression across immune cell types, 
using the Open Problems – Single-Cell Perturbations dataset (a NeurIPS 2023 Kaggle competition) . 
This repo includes data prep, ChemBERTa molecular embeddings, exploratory analysis, and baseline models 
(XGBoost, MLP, GRU) evaluated with the competition’s Mean Row-wise RMSE (MRRMSE) metric.
